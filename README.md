Deep Learning Algorithms – From Scratch 🚀
This repository is dedicated to building deep learning algorithms from scratch, without relying on built-in libraries. It’s easy to write a few lines of code using pre-built functions, but truly understanding how things work under the hood sets you apart from others in the field.

Why This Repository? 🤔
Many beginners rush through ML/DL concepts, focusing on implementation with high-level libraries. While this approach might seem efficient, it often lacks depth and real understanding.

✔️ Having a strong theoretical foundation is important.
✔️ But "Scratch Implementation" is the key to mastering the inner workings of these algorithms.

This repo is designed to help beginners and intermediate-level learners gain hands-on experience and build a strong intuition for deep learning models. By working through these implementations, you'll stand out from the crowd and truly grasp how deep learning works at its core.

Algorithms Covered 🧠⚡
✅ Basic Neural Networks – The foundation of deep learning.
✅ Logistic Regression (with Neural Networks) – Understanding linear classifiers deeply.
✅ Autoencoders – Learn how unsupervised learning can reconstruct data.
✅ RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) – Master sequence-based models.
✅ LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory Networks) – Solve vanishing gradient issues in RNNs.
✅ GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) – Create and generate new data with adversarial learning.

Who Is This For? 👨‍💻👩‍💻
🔹 Beginners who want to truly understand how deep learning models work internally.
🔹 Intermediate learners looking to strengthen their knowledge by implementing everything from scratch.
🔹 Anyone who believes in learning the right way instead of just copy-pasting code!

So, let’s dive deep, break things down, and build something awesome from the ground up! 🚀🔥
