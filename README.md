# **Deep Learning Algorithms using Numpy – From Scratch 🚀**  

This repository is dedicated to **building deep learning algorithms from scratch**, without relying on built-in libraries. It’s easy to write a few lines of code using pre-built functions, but truly understanding how things work under the hood **sets you apart** from others in the field.

## **Why This Repository? 🤔**  
Many beginners rush through ML/DL concepts, focusing on implementation with high-level libraries. While this approach might seem efficient, it often **lacks depth and real understanding**.  

✔️ **Having a strong theoretical foundation is important.**  
✔️ But **"Scratch Implementation"** is the key to mastering the inner workings of these algorithms.  

This repo is designed to help **beginners and intermediate-level learners** gain **hands-on experience** and build a **strong intuition** for deep learning models. By working through these implementations, you'll **stand out from the crowd** and truly grasp **how deep learning works at its core**.
